# The Stickwich
## A 3D printable video game controller enclosure for Two Step digital analog stick based controllers.

So You built a Two Step stick but you need an enclosure to build a full controller with? Behold! The Stickwich!

The name comes from the design being 2 pieces sandwiched together with M6 bolts and nuts. The original version of this I made for my Two Step prototype controller was 2 pieces of plywood and 1/4-20 nuts and bolts lol.

currently this enclosure is for a hand wired controller design. I do plan to design a pcb that will encompass everything but for now this is what i can offer at this time. 

## Hardware needed: 
4 M6 x 40mm bolts  
4 M6 nuts  
4 M4 x 10 flat head screws for mounting the Two Step
4 M4 nuts
4 M2 x 10 screws (to mount the Raspberry Pi Pico into the controller)  
adhesive backed neoprene sheets or your preferred grip option. 
Model UD BirdD usb c breakout board https://github.com/HTangl/Model-UD or this breakout board from amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07771CFFM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details

## Tools needed
3d printer with a 300x300 build volume or order the files from a 3d printing service such as jlcpcb (files for standard ender 3 build volume coming soon)  
allen keys  
precision phillips head screwdriver  
xacto knife  
fine point tweezers  
optional: heat gun (helps make removing the supports easier)  

I would like to credit Bjart's Rana Digital controller https://github.com/rana-sylvatica/rana-digital for providing me with the button layout design that I adopted into this project. These files are labeled "Digital" whereas the files for 24mm arcade buttons are labeled "24mm"

I have provided standard 8 button layouts for melee as well as a 6 button layout for Smash ultimate as it does not use light shield and medium shield.

When printing the files you will want to print the top pieces face down. If you are printing the 24mm arcade button version you will not need any supports but the digital button files do need supports.

The bottom piece is universal for all top versions. It does require supports for the hex nut holes. These supports can be a bit tricky to remove but a heat gun and an xacto knife/fine point tweezers helps tremendously.

## Assembly Instructions

Assembly of the Stickwich is very simple. The entire case is held together with 4 M6 x 40mm bolts and 4 M6 nuts. 

To insert the M6 nuts into the hex holes on the bottom of the bottom piece I find using an M6 bolt with a nut threaded up the top of the bolt and a washer Works perfectly. insert the bolt with the nut and washer through the hole from the top and then thread on the nut that is going to be inserted into the hex hole until it is flush with the bottom surface and the edges line up with the edges of the hex hole. Then using an allen key (or screwdriver if your M6 bolts use Philips head) begin tightening the bolt which will sink the nut into the Hex hole until it is flush and secured. then remove the bolt and repeat for all 4 corners.

Once this is done you are able to line up your top and bottom pieces and insert your M6 x 40 bolts into all 4 corner holes and tighten them into the nuts you secured into the bottom piece. Tighten until the top piece is secured tightly (does not need to be over tightened) and you are done with the assembly. This guide will not cover wiring up the controller as that is covered in the Two Step guide.

# ENJOY YOUR CONTROLLER!
